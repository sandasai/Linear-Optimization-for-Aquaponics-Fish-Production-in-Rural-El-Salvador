# Linear Optimization for Aquaponics Fish-Production in Rural El Salvador
MATH 462 Project

A mathematical model to optimize the number of fish within a community that is implementing aquaponics to diversify crops

Aquaponics farming systems provide a sustainable and cost-effective source of crop production beyond the rainy season in tropical monsoon climates while negating the use of expensive fertilizers.  The fresh water fish reservoirs associated with each system serve not only as a source of nitrogen waste necessary for plant growth, but also as a source of food itself to be eaten or sold.  A pilot program in May 2014 implemented the construction of 30 aquaponics systems within a small rural community in El Salvador.  In the community being investigated, the system owners are presented with the decision to eat the fish within their own system, sell their supply locally, or sell fish to a distant market with a high demand.  We propose a linear optimization model addressing the multiple variables and constraints involved in the decision process of consuming, selling locally, or selling to the market while meeting the goals of the local government and the goals of the non-profit to expand systems throughout the community.
